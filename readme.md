At the beginning, a player need to type the number of players and the system will help each player draw a number from 1 to 10 randomly, which decides the order of the player in the game (the player with the biggest number will start first). If there are 2 players, a card pool consists of two suits of cards from A to K will be generated, where there are totally 26 cards in the card pool. If there are 3 or 4 players, a card pool consists of three suits of cards from A to K will be generated, where there are 39 cards in the card pool. The cards from A to 10 represent 1 to 10 points, and J, Q, K represents 11, 12 ,13 points respectively. Each game consist of 6 rounds, in each round every players can choose to draw a card from the card pool, or discard a card from their hand. After 6 rounds, the player with exactly 27 points wins. If the game is a draw because two or more players meet the winning condition, the players who meet the winning condition will play another game to decide the winner. On the other hand, if the game is a draw because no one meet the winning condition, all players will play another game to decide the winner. The game will keep repeating until there is a winner.
